MIP emphasis: balance optimality and feasibility.
MIP search method: dynamic search.
Parallel mode: deterministic, using up to 24 threads.

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.02 sec. (8.42 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 24 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.02 sec. (8.42 ticks)
Solution status: Optimal
Optimal value: 0
